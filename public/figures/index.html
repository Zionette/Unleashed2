	<p>&ldquo;In order to change an existing paradigm you do not struggle to try and change the problematic model.</p>
<p>You create a new model and make the old ones obsolete.  That, in essence, is the higher service to which we are all being called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~ Buckminster Fuller ~</p>
<p>One Community is a 501(c)3 non-profit think tank. We are a 100%-volunteer organization
and our mission is to help people create a better world by demonstrating a more
sustainable and enriching way of living and open source everything needed for replication.
This includes free-shared and “Highest Good” approaches to food, energy, housing, education,
for-profit and non-profit economic design, social architecture, fulfilled living, global
stewardship practices, and more. Combined, we will use these to build One Community as the
first of many teacher/demonstration hubs. These hubs will form a global collaborative to
provide even more research, blueprints, and necessary support for successively easier, more
affordable, and creative duplication everywhere.</p>
<p>SKILLS EVERY MEMBER OF OUR TEAM HAS</p>
<p>Every member of the One Community team has a foundational set of skills that help us keep
moving forward in a way that is effective, efficient, and enjoyable. Anyone interested in
joining our team should exemplify these as well.</p>
