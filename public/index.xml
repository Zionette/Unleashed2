			<description>&lt;p&gt;As a family, we, Alosha &amp;amp; Zoya from Bio-Veda Academy, have abandoned our home in the final
stages of mortgage repayment. It was not an easy decision, but one that completely flipped
our lives, unlocking incredible opportunities we could have never dreamt possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why we have much to share about these bold, scary steps as we break through to a
new reality we are co-creating with our bare hands!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll inspire you to learn a variety of simple DIY skills and underline their importance
in gaining independence from the system!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our step-by-step journey and facts about our life will show you how to fearlessly and
painlessly set yourself free from the hamster wheel trap of our current, socially insane
paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our YouTube VLOG and website we share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-how we, only husband &amp;amp; wife, build our home together, with our bare hands, without any labour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-how to live in a new reality, independent from the system and monetary &amp;ldquo;needle&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-homesteading, food forest gardening, and permaculture in action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-growing an abundance of healthy, organic food with minimal inputs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-travelling, couch-surfing style, as well as eco-community building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s virtually impossible to engage in the above while humanity is trapped in an inferiority
complex formed during childhood by a system whose main purpose is suppressing a child&amp;rsquo;s willpower,
enthusiasm, and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our content, we share recommendations of the necessary internal process work that
empowers constructive, external actions leading to harmony, self-sufficiency and thriving…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take strategic steps, born from the state of inner balance, to build a new reality
that makes the old one obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent global changes and the post-global quarantine period have opened the floodgates of
unlimited opportunities that seemed impossible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is a perfect time to break old moulds of enslavement as we transition into new waters
of off-grid, sustainable and wholesome living.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Constitutional Sheriffs &amp; Peace Officers Association</title>
			<link>https://people-unleashed.com/typography/</link>

			<media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://people-unleashed.com/img/SheriffMack.png" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The CSPOA was started because of the huge need to remind sheriffs and peace officers about their oath of office.
Throughout America, law enforcement agencies have a slogan that defines the primary function of the agency. The slogan, which has been used for decades, yet which has been removed from the door of many police agency patrol vehicles, is To Protect and Serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to take a long hard look at the meaning of this slogan, and make sure that our individual and collective philosophy as well as our individual attitude and behavior reflects this worthy objective.
Peace officers have a tougher job today than 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society seems to be polarized into two camps. One loves the police, and the other hates us. It may be partially due to the fact that some peace officers, and some training modules seem to foster the belief that we are somehow “better” than the people we serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to a “badge heavy” attitude, and sometimes to the excessive use of force. This must not continue.  We must eliminate any training or behavior that tarnishes the badge, including the “code of silence”.
Making its way to America, the Sheriff held his office as the highest law enforcement officer within that county jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very important, considering that most peace officers are “sworn officers”, who take oaths to support the state and U.S. Constitutions. The same oath being sworn by the sheriff when constitutionally elected to office is significant in the fact that he or she is the first line of defense in preserving the Constitutional rights of a citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the Office of the Sheriff, combined with the historical powers held by that office, he stands as the upholder, defender, protector and servant to the liberties of the people within the county.
In addition to upholding the law, the sheriff is also charged with upholding the supreme law, the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law enforcement powers held by the sheriff supersede those of any agent, officer, elected official or employee from any level of government when in the jurisdiction of the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical separation of powers in the Constitution makes it clear that the power of the sheriff even supersedes the powers of the President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is this responsibility that grants a Sheriff the Constitutional authority to check and balance all levels of government within the jurisdiction of the County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And other peace officers, including police officers and others with arrest powers, join with the Sheriff and deputies, as Constitutional Guards, with one and the same mission:  to protect life, liberty and property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association brings together We The People of the United States with peace officers and sheriffs, educating all in an effort to restore America peacefully for our posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can join our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cspoa.org//&#34;&gt;CSPOA&lt;/a&gt; Posse and learn how to help restore Liberty in your county.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;TOGETHER WE STAND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you wish to be free?&amp;hellip;.. If desire for freedom from a tyrannical power structure exists while restoring peace, then Earth United is a light for our world to go. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter who or what your background or beliefs are, these are FACTS that require action as this truth affects us all once known&amp;hellip; and the time to correct and reclaim our FREEDOM , Sovereignty &amp;amp; power is now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All governments [which are JUST a service corporation] world wide by design commit massive theft and fraud against the people. How this fact is achieved occurs by a TRESPASS [unlawful conversion] against every man and woman moments after we are born. Our mother and father are not shown or told nor do the honorable doctors and nurses know filling out paper work what is occurring in that moment&amp;hellip;and neither does a baby moments old laying in a crib. At this moment our identities are stolen to create a legal person [corporation in our names/ birth certificates] and this is where the world must go as this light is now finally being brought out and into the light for the world to see&amp;hellip; this ONE truth hidden insures the people will no longer be ignorant or controlled as a slave&amp;hellip; and given the power together to face head on the creators of this enslavement system once and for all so this evil never sees the light of day again. This ONE truth brought forth now&amp;hellip;is our armor and spear and this evil WILL end!&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) catalyzes communities for a regenerative world. GEN
is a growing network of regenerative communities and initiatives that bridge cultures,
countries, and continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEN builds bridges between policy-makers, governments, NGOs, academics, entrepreneurs,
activists, community networks and ecologically-minded individuals across the globe in
order to develop strategies for a global transition to resilient communities and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is an Ecovillage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ecovillage is an intentional, traditional or urban community that is consciously
designing its pathway through locally owned, participatory processes, and aiming to
address the Ecovillage Principles in the 4 Areas of Regeneration (social, culture,
ecology, economy into a whole systems design).
Ecovillages are living laboratories pioneering beautiful alternatives and innovative
solutions. They are rural or urban settlements with vibrant social structures, vastly
diverse, yet united in their actions towards low-impact, high-quality lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In order to change an existing paradigm you do not struggle to try and change the problematic model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You create a new model and make the old ones obsolete.  That, in essence, is the higher service to which we are all being called.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Community is a 501(c)3 non-profit think tank. We are a 100%-volunteer organization

This includes free-shared and “Highest Good” approaches to food, energy, housing, education,
for-profit and non-profit economic design, social architecture, fulfilled living, global
stewardship practices, and more. Combined, we will use these to build One Community as the
first of many teacher/demonstration hubs. These hubs will form a global collaborative to
provide even more research, blueprints, and necessary support for successively easier, more
affordable, and creative duplication everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>One Small Town</title>
			<link>https://people-unleashed.com/other-features/</link>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a perfect world full of harmony and abundance. The kind of world most of us have
dreamed of all our lives. This world is possible and we are creating it for ourselves –
not somewhere in the distant future, but now, in our own lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preamble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The socio-economic structure of our country and our world has failed us dramatically.
The freedom that our forefathers strived for is in danger of being lost forever.
We can no longer sit idly by, watching the destruction of our country, our towns, and
human potential, by greedy corporations, supported by a government with no remorse for
its actions, or accountability to the people it is supposed to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can no longer sit silently, hoping that someone will do something to stop this assault
on our liberties and future prosperity. It has fallen on the shoulders of the common
people to unite and create a new way, a new system and a beautiful life for ourselves
and our children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ubuntu Movement has a simple plan to turn our small towns into places of abundance
and prosperity for all the people, where there are no hurdles to progress or restrictions
on personal growth of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities that will support and promote unbridled creative expression in all areas of
our lives – arts, culture, science, technology, healthcare, environment, architecture,
agriculture, and all other areas of human activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order to create such harmonious communities, we, the people, must lead a Revolution
of Consciousness, without the need for any violence, opposition or conflict – by simply
creating a new alternative – a new system – a new way of doing things – because the old
way simply does not work for us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are creating a new system in which we turn competition into collaboration. A new
society in which we all benefit from our collective efforts and individual talents.
We will no longer be the slaves that enrich the corporations and a few powerful individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Inspiration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ubuntu” is an African expression of ancient wisdom, which is echoed by all ancient civilizations.
It simply means “unity within community” where everyone contributes their natural talents or skills
for the greater benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The native American Cherokee have a similar philosophy that says; “if it’s not good for everyone,
it’s no good at all”. This philosophy is one of the founding principles of our proposed system of
Contributionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ubuntu plan provides a blueprint for a new social structure, which delivers freedom from financial
slavery to the whole town and everyone who participates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu Planet is focused on creating the first One Small Town, to lead by example, and serve as a
model for all other towns anywhere in the world. The objectives are very simple and very achievable
– but it will require us to WORK TOGETHER – UNITED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unite the people in a simple vision and objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where possible, provide our town with our own supply of electricity, which will support all our
activities and liberate the town from reliance on the electricity grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejuvenate our town with diverse industry and innovation that will provide work for everyone – not just a chosen few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support our inventors and scientists to create new technologies on every level which will include an alternative
energy supply that is eco-friendly and provide electricity at no cost to the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support our farmers to grow an abundance of organic food and banish GMO companies like Monsanto that are destroying
our seeds and food security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support our healers to develop new methods and technologies that truly heal people, and provide cures for most
diseases, which many of us know is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the growth of traditional healing plants and prevent the pharmaceutical mafia from eliminating these plants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support our teachers to develop an alternative education system that teaches our children real skills for life and
opens their eyes to infinite possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support our Master Craftsmen to share their knowledge and skills with those who wish to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolve into communities free from the economic stranglehold created by the banking cartels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolution of change happens not with guns or violence like our forefathers, but with the perspective that change
can happen within a community based on our combined efforts. Existing laws and financial structures will be used to
create this self-sustaining community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a broad level, this manifesto outlines our goals and methods to provide a transparent view of how easily change can
happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are key elements to establishing the first small town:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A population between 4000 – 7000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mayor, Town Manager, City Council, and Sheriff are fully supportive of the mission to rejuvenate their town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 20% of the residents express their support for the One Small Town initiative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the unique opportunities of the town including the agricultural and environmental possibilities that will be
utilized for the benefit of the community and the investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the skills and abilities of the people who have expressed their support for initiative as an indicator for
launching new projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the existing factories and industry (some of which may be dormant) to strategically plan for new projects and
businesses to launch in the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funding is needed to create and renovate manufacturing facilities, equipment, tools, and supplies to create a wide
range of products and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed business plans to offer investors a truly unique opportunity to help the town rejuvenate rapidly.
We call it “Adopt a Small Town”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a truly unique investment opportunity in which the investor will have the following benefits not normally
associated with the capitalist model:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full support of the whole community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No hostile competition from other businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free labor from the community participation in all the community projects. This is also a unique funding opportunity
for conscious millionaires who care about their hometowns and want to save them from further decay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful businesses, currently in the town, are encouraged to help support the One Small Town initiative by investing
in other project/business plans that help achieve the town’s self-sustainable goals and generate a profit for the
investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every new community project/business will have a strategically chosen project manager; master craftsman or expert in
that specific area; and a small group of skilled workers in that field. These appointed workers will be paid normal
salaries as the backbone of that business. The rest of the labor will come from the community contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every person who contributes 3 hours per week towards community projects receives their share of the benefits from
all the projects. This provides a simple solution during the initial transition phase. Everyone can keep their jobs
and continue with their lives as normal, but make themselves available for their 3-hour community work every week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weekly contribution work will be assigned by a central project manager. In exchange for the 3-hour contribution,
every participant receives free goods and services from all the community projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The town produces 3x the needs of the community, in all that we grow or produce.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One third is retained for the contributing community members who receive their share of all the goods and services
at no cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other two thirds are sold to non-community members and other distribution sources at fair or below market
prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The profits are distributed back to the community as such:
1/3 of the profits goes towards the investor; 1/3 goes to the community bank; and 1/3 goes to the contributing
members of the community as personal income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Priorities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first priority for every small town is to create sustainable water supply, agriculture and food security. This may
require indoor and permaculture farming in addition to livestock, dairy and bakery.  Other industries will be created
based on resources of the town and products/services that are in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Contributionism is to achieve freedom and abundance for all community members. To do this, it is necessary
to transition to a society with a primary focus on cooperation rather than capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All needs and wants of the community will be provided through the shared efforts of labor to create abundance. The goods
and services created will be sold outside the community and to non-contributing town members for a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize the need for money for interactions outside of the community, but within the community there will, eventually,
be no need or use for money, allowing for the transition to an abundant moneyless community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trust that the financial distributions of profits to community members will create a higher level of steady income
than current employment, allowing the members to free themselves from undesirable “jobs” and commit to more active participation
in community projects of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very soon, we will birth a community where we can create, build, grow, invent, invest, and implement anything we desire
because the obstacles to progress have been removed from our society. It all begins with ONE SMALL TOWN.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;“Our success is contingent upon the highest moral idea “the greatest good to the greatest number”. Aspiration, desire, and harmonious relations, constantly and persistently maintained, will accomplish results. Well-Being comes from Well-Doing”. ~ Charles F. Haanel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission: Rise Up - Impact - Explore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion. Encourage. Opportunity. Power. Love. Energy. (P.E.O.P.L.E) To heal the earth and bring global
community back to the planet. Building sustainable villages by the means of Permaculture.  Permaculture is about
designing sustainable human settlements. It is a philosophy and an approach to land use which weaves together
micro-climate, annual and perennial plants, animals, soils, water management, and human needs into intricately
connected productive communities.&lt;/p&gt;
