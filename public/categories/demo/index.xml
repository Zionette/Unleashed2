      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a family, we, Alosha &amp;amp; Zoya from Bio-Veda Academy, have abandoned our home in the final
stages of mortgage repayment. It was not an easy decision, but one that completely flipped
our lives, unlocking incredible opportunities we could have never dreamt possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why we have much to share about these bold, scary steps as we break through to a
new reality we are co-creating with our bare hands!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
